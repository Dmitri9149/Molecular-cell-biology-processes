### Computational Molecular Cell Biology

The project is intended for giving computational semantics 
for Molecular Cell Biology processes. Immune system will be 
used as a system, which in some way consolidate all the important 
processes in the Molecuar Cell Biology. 

What we mean by semantics: the biological processes will be 
'projected' to the well understood computational processes. 

Different process calculi like pi- and join clalculus will be 
used intensely, because it corresponds to the nature of molecular cell biology as  
asynchronous, parallel , concurrent and distributed processes.

The JoCaml, F#, Haskell, Idris will be used in the project. The languages 
have implementations of the pi- and join- calculi. And Idris support 
complex name spaces and Types as first class citizens.  
Quite possible Links, and Q# will be also in use. 

The project is running. Some parts are in just a draft form. 

See the draft of the first part: "Name_Spaces.ipynb"
